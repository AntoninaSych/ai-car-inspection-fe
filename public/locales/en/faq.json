      "question": "How does the AI car damage assessment work?",
      "answer": "Our AI-powered system uses advanced computer vision algorithms to analyze photos of your damaged vehicle. Simply upload clear images of the damage, and our AI will identify the affected parts, assess the extent of damage, and provide a preliminary repair cost estimate within minutes."
    },
    {
      "question": "How accurate is the AI estimate?",
      "answer": "Our AI provides a preliminary estimate based on visible damage in the photos. While we strive for high accuracy, the actual repair cost may vary due to hidden damage not visible in photos, regional pricing differences, and specific service station rates. We recommend using our estimate as a starting point for planning."
    },
    {
      "question": "What types of damage can the AI detect?",
      "answer": "Our AI can identify various types of vehicle damage including dents, scratches, broken parts, paint damage, cracked glass, and structural damage. It analyzes body panels, bumpers, doors, hoods, fenders, and other visible components."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many photos do I need to upload?",
      "answer": "We recommend uploading at least 3-5 clear photos showing the damage from different angles. Include close-up shots of damaged areas and wider shots showing the overall context. More photos generally lead to more accurate assessments."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is my data secure and private?",
      "answer": "Yes, we take data security seriously. All uploaded photos are encrypted and stored securely. We automatically blur license plates and faces for privacy. Your data is used only for providing the service and improving our AI models, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and GDPR regulations."
